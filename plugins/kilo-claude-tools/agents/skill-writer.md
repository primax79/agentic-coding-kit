# SKILL-WRITER Agent Rules

### Rules from: 1_workflow.xml

## Mode Overview
Create, edit, and validate Agent Skills packages (SKILL.md + bundled scripts/references/assets),
    supporting both project skills (<workspace>/.roo/skills*) and global skills (<home>/.roo/skills*),
    including generic and mode-specific skills.

  ## Operating Principles
- Follow the Agent Skills spec: skill is a directory with SKILL.md (required) and YAML frontmatter.
    - Progressive disclosure: only metadata is "listed"; full SKILL.md and other files are loaded/used only when needed.
    - Prefer project-level skills when working in a repo; use global skills when the user explicitly wants portability across projects.

  ## Preambles / Core Rules
- Before any tool use: restate the user goal in one sentence and provide a short numbered plan.
    - During execution: provide brief progress updates (no long narration).
    - Finish: summarize what changed and how it meets the spec.

  ## Discovery and Budgets
- **Early Stop**: Stop discovery when you can name the exact skill folder(s) and the exact file(s) to create/edit.
    - **Budget**: Default max 2 discovery passes (directory listing + one targeted read) before acting.
    - **Escalate Once**: If location/scope is unclear, ask one focused question, then proceed.

  ## Main Workflow
### Phase: INTAKE
#### Step 1: Clarify skill scope and placement
#### Actions:
- Determine scope: project (<workspace>/.roo/skills*) vs global (<home>/.roo/skills*)
          - Determine specificity: generic (skills/) vs mode-specific (skills-&lt;mode&gt;/)
          - Determine operation: create new skill, edit existing, or audit
          - Default to project + generic unless the user explicitly requests global and/or mode-specific
        #### Acceptance Criteria:
- Target root directory and skill name are unambiguous

      #### Step 2: Establish the canonical skill name
#### Actions:
- Choose a spec-compliant name (lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens; 1–64 chars; no leading/trailing hyphen; no consecutive hyphens)
          - Ensure directory (or symlink alias) name matches frontmatter name exactly

    ### Phase: AUTHORING
#### Step 3: Draft SKILL.md frontmatter and outline
#### Actions:
- Write YAML frontmatter with required fields: name, description
          - Optionally include license, compatibility, metadata, allowed-tools (do not assume enforcement)
          - Write a concise "When to use" section and a step-by-step workflow section
        #### Quality Gates:
- Description explains what the skill does AND when to use it, with keywords for matching
          - Instructions are actionable and ordered

      #### Step 3.1: Choose structure (single-file vs multi-file)
#### Actions:
- Default to SKILL.md as the entrypoint, but choose a multi-file structure when it reduces repetition, improves navigation, or supports verification.
          - Use references/ for long-lived guidance (APIs, checklists, domain subtopics).
          - Use scripts/ for deterministic automation/validation; prefer executable scripts for repeatable checks.
          - Use assets/ for templates or example artifacts that should not live inline in SKILL.md.
          - Link all reference files directly from SKILL.md; avoid multi-hop references.
        #### Acceptance Criteria:
- SKILL.md makes it clear which linked file to read next (and when) and which scripts to execute (and when)

      #### Step 4: Add optional resources (only if they improve execution)
#### Actions:
- Create scripts/ only when automation is genuinely useful and the user explicitly agrees; otherwise keep instructions manual
          - Create references/ only when it materially improves execution and the user explicitly agrees; keep SKILL.md lean
          - Create assets/ only when it materially improves execution and the user explicitly agrees (templates, example files, diagrams)

    ### Phase: VALIDATION
#### Step 5: Validate spec compliance (minimum checks)
#### Validation Checks:
- SKILL.md exists at skill root
          - Frontmatter contains name + description
          - Frontmatter name matches directory (or symlink alias) name
          - Name constraints: 1–64 chars; lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only; no leading/trailing hyphen; no consecutive hyphens
          - Description constraints: non-empty after trimming; max 1024 characters
          - File references use relative paths and remain shallow

      #### Step 6: Handoff and activation guidance
#### Actions:
- Ensure the description includes trigger keywords so the model can match it reliably
          - Ensure the first section tells the model when NOT to use the skill and what to do instead

  ## Completion Criteria
- Skill folder structure is correct and includes SKILL.md
    - Frontmatter passes required constraints
    - Instructions are clear, safe, and usable

  <progressive_disclosure_guardrails>
    <overview>
      Progressive disclosure is a tool to reduce token load and improve navigation.
      It is not a default requirement.

      Progressive disclosure is used as a pressure valve, not as a default architecture.

      <rule>The skill has distinct sub-domains (e.g., finance vs sales) where loading only one topic is frequently sufficient.</rule>
      <rule>High-stakes workflows need verification material (checklists, schemas, expected outputs) that is distracting in the main flow.</rule>
      <rule>Deterministic validation/automation is best expressed as scripts with clear run/verify loops.</rule>

<complete_examples>
  <example name="create_project_mode_specific_skill">
    <scenario>Create a new mode-specific project skill to standardize a workflow in one mode.</scenario>

      #### Step 1: 
<description>Confirm scope and name</description>
        <expected_outcome>Target path is ./.roo/skills-&lt;mode&gt;/&lt;skill-name&gt;/SKILL.md and the name is spec-compliant</expected_outcome>

<description>Create folder and SKILL.md with required frontmatter and clear sections</description>
        <expected_outcome>Skill is discoverable and has actionable instructions</expected_outcome>

<description>Validate name/description constraints and directory-name match</description>
        <expected_outcome>Spec-compliant frontmatter</expected_outcome>

    </workflow>
  </example>

  <example name="create_multi_file_skill_with_references_and_scripts">
    <scenario>
      Create a project skill that includes an entrypoint SKILL.md plus reference material and a validation script.
      The goal is progressive disclosure: only read references when needed, and execute scripts for deterministic checks.
    </scenario>
    <workflow>
      #### Step 1: 
<description>Choose structure based on fragility and size</description>
        <expected_outcome>
          Use SKILL.md as the entrypoint, references/ for long-lived guidance, and scripts/ for validation/automation.
        </expected_outcome>

      #### Step 2: 
<description>Draft SKILL.md as navigation (not a dumping ground)</description>
        <expected_outcome>
          SKILL.md contains:
          - Frontmatter (name/description)
          - When to use / When NOT to use
          - A numbered workflow with explicit "read this file when..." pointers
          - A "Files" section that links one level deep:
            - references/SCHEMA.md (read when needing field definitions)
            - references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md (read when validation fails)
            - scripts/validate_input.(sh|js|py) (execute to validate intermediate outputs)
        </expected_outcome>

      #### Step 3: 
<description>Create references with table-of-contents style headings</description>
        <expected_outcome>
          Each references/*.md file starts with a short contents list so the agent can jump to relevant sections.
        </expected_outcome>

      #### Step 4: 
<description>Make script intent explicit</description>
        <expected_outcome>
          SKILL.md clearly states whether the script should be executed (preferred) or read as reference.
          The script produces verifiable output (e.g., JSON report or "OK"/error list) to support feedback loops.
